                <h1>Fundamental Operations in Algebra</h1><br>
                <p>Fundamental operations in algebra are basic mathematical operations used to manipulate algebraic expressions and solve equations. There are four fundamental operations in algebra: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations are the building blocks of algebraic computations and are essential for understanding and solving equations and expressions.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Addition</h3>
<p>Addition is the operation of combining two or more numbers or algebraic terms to obtain their sum. In algebra, when adding like terms (terms with the same variable and exponent), we add the coefficients while keeping the variable and exponent unchanged. For example, to add 2x and 3x, we combine the coefficients to get 5x. When adding terms with different variables or exponents, we cannot simplify further.</p>

<div class="Example">
    <p class="example">Example:</p>
    <img src="FOA/image001.png" alt="2x + 3x = 5x">  
</div>  
<hr>
<h3>Subtraction</h3>
<p>Subtraction is the operation of taking away one number or algebraic term from another. In algebra, subtraction can be thought of as adding the opposite or negation of a number. When subtracting algebraic terms, we apply the distributive property and combine like terms if possible.</p>
<div class="Example">
    <p>Example:</p>
    <img src="FOA/image002.png" alt="3x - 2x = x">  
</div> 
<hr>
<h3>Multiplication</h3>
<p>Multiplication is the operation of repeated addition or scaling of a number or algebraic term. In algebra, when multiplying algebraic terms, we apply the distributive property and multiply coefficients and combine variables using the laws of exponents. When multiplying constants or like terms, we simply multiply their coefficients.</p>

<div class="Example">
    <p>Example:</p>
    <img src="FOA/image003.png" alt="2x * 3x = 6x^2">  
</div>
<hr>
<h3>Division</h3>
<p>Division is the operation of splitting a number or algebraic expression into equal parts. In algebra, division involves finding the quotient by dividing one term by another. Division by zero is undefined in algebra.</p>

<div class="Example">
    <p>Example:</p>
    <img src="FOA/image004.png" alt="6x^2 / 3x = 2x">  
</div>
<hr>
<p>These four fundamental operations can be combined and used iteratively to solve more complex equations and expressions. It is crucial to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) while performing these operations to ensure accurate results. Parentheses, exponents, multiplication, and division should be performed before addition and subtraction.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Exponents</h3>
<p>Exponents in algebra are a way to represent repeated multiplication of a number or a variable by itself. They are also referred to as powers. An exponent is a small number written above and to the right of a base number or variable. The exponent indicates how many times the base is multiplied by itself.
</p><p>When the exponent is a positive integer, it represents repeated multiplication. For example, 2^3 means 2 multiplied by itself three times: 2 * 2 * 2, resulting in 8.</p>

<div class="Example">
    <p>Example:</p>
    <img src="FOA/image005.png" alt="2^3  = 2× 2× 2 = 8"><br>
    <img src="FOA/image006.png" alt="5^2= 5× 5 = 25">  

</div><hr>

<h3>Like and Unlike Terms:</h3>
<p>Addition and Subtraction with Like Terms and Unlike Terms:</p>
<p>When dealing with like terms, which have the same variable(s) and exponent(s), we can add or subtract them by combining their coefficients while keeping the variable(s) and exponent(s) unchanged. Here's how it works:</p>

<div class="Example">
    <p>Example:</p>
    <img src="FOA/image007.png" alt="3x + 2x"><br>
    <img src="FOA/image008.png" alt="= (3 + 2)x"><br>
    <img src="FOA/image009.png" alt="= 5x"><hr>

    <img src="FOA/image010.png" alt="-4y^2  - 2y^2"><br>
    <img src="FOA/image011.png" alt="= (-4 - 2) y^2"><br>
    <img src="FOA/image012.png" alt="= -6y^2">
</div>

<p>In both examples, we added or subtracted the coefficients while keeping the variables and exponents unchanged.</p>
<p>Unlike terms have different variables or exponents. When adding or subtracting unlike terms, we cannot simplify them further because they are not compatible for combining. Thus, we can only perform operations within their own terms.</p>

<div class="Example">
    <p>Example:</p>
    <img src="FOA/image013.png" alt="3x + 2y"><hr>

    <img src="FOA/image014.png" alt="-4x^2  + 5y^2"><br>
</div>

<p>In both examples, we cannot add or subtract the terms since they have different variables or exponents. So, unlike terms remain as they are and cannot be simplified.</p>
<br><p>Multiplication with Like and Unlike Terms:</p>
<p>Multiplication in algebra involves multiplying coefficients and combining variables using the laws of exponents.</p>
<p>When multiplying like terms, we multiply their coefficients while keeping the variables and exponents unchanged.</p>

<div class="Example">
    <p>Example:</p>
    <img src="FOA/image015.png" alt="3x× 2x = (3×2)(x×x) = 6x^2"><hr>
    <img src="FOA/image016.png" alt="-4y^2× 2y^3  = (-4×2)(y^2×y^3) = -8y^5">
</div>

<p>In both examples, we multiplied the coefficients and applied the exponent laws to combine the variables.</p>
<p>When multiplying unlike terms, we apply the distributive property. Each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression.</p>

<div class="Example">
    <p>Example:</p>
    <img src="FOA/image017.png" alt="(3x + 2y)(4x + 5y)">
    <p>To multiply these unlike terms, we distribute each term of the first expression to each term of the second expression:</p>
    <img src="FOA/image018.png" alt="= 3x × 4x + 3x× 5y + 2y × 4x + 2y × 5y">
    <img src="FOA/image019.png" alt="= 12x^2  + 15xy + 8xy + 10y^2"><br>
    <img src="FOA/image020.png" alt="= 12x^2  + 23xy + 10y^2 ">
</div>

<p>In this example, we multiplied each term in the first expression with each term in the second expression and then simplified the resulting expression. We shall learn more about it in the next module.</p>
<br>
<p>Division with Like and Unlike Terms:</p>
<p>Division in algebra involves dividing the coefficients and applying the laws of exponents.</p>
<p>When dividing like terms, we divide their coefficients while keeping the variables and exponents unchanged.</p>
<div class="Example">
    <p>Example:</p>
    <img src="FOA/image021.png" alt="(6x^2)/3x  = (6/3)(x^2/x) = 2x">
    </div>

<p>In this example, we divided the coefficients and applied the exponent laws to simplify the expression.</p>
<p>Division with unlike terms is not possible because the terms are not compatible for division. Thus, unlike terms remain as they are and cannot be simplified using division.</p>
<hr>
<p>These fundamental operations in algebra allow us to manipulate and simplify expressions and equations, making them essential tools for solving problems and working with algebraic concepts.</p>
